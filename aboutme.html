        <h3 class="title">The Basic Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, i'm a Venezuelan young man born in Barquisimeto-Lara but raise in many other parts
            of my country.<br> I have been passionated for technology since i was a kid, so in this time
            i am learning as many things as i can about IT and programming wich lead me to writing this lines
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">So, What about now?</h3>
        <p>
            Actually i'm a Systems Engineering student at <em>Universidad Nacional Abierta</em>
            <br>and also Telecomunications technician student at <em>Universidad Politecnica Territorial de Aragua</em>
            but  i have many interests mainly focused on Computers and Electronics
        </p>
   
        <h5>Some of my personal interests are:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I <strong>Love</strong> Computers.</li>
            <li>Sci-Fi things</li>
            <li>Pop culture</li>
            <li>Movies of many genres, in recent years i've been developing me as a kind of cinephile</li>
            <li>Anything that has to do with Music even when i know basicly nothing about it.</li>
            <li>I <strong>love</strong> Rock and Electronic music, and sometimes both combined</li>
            <li>Robots are love, robots are life.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Some of the stuff i believe are:</h5>

        <ol>
            <li>Do things for you but that benefit others as well</li>
            <li><em>Love is all you need.</em><a href="https://www.deezer.com/es/track/126848617" target="_blank"><img src="./resources/images/Play-Button.png" alt="play" width="20" height="20"/></a></li>
            <li>Happiness is not a precise moment of your life. It is a complex process that you build for years
                but that is worth doing!
            </li>
            <li>I don't spread hate, in fact is hard to make me angry. But i definitely hate Mediocrity.</li>
            <li>Carpe Diem</li>
            <li>Knowledge is power.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As an internet culture fan, i grew playing videogames (where i wasn't "really good gamer" btw) so by tradition one
            can stick to a nickname, usually this is mine:<br> <br> 
            <img src="./resources/images/davlu-bannner.bmp" alt="nickname of DavLu" width="500" height="240"/>
            <br>
            As you could see is not any complicated or with deep meaning is just some mix  of my first and middle name
        </p>
